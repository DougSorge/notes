      <h1>Welcome to Express.</h1>
      <p>
        Express is a framework that helps us to buld web applications and API's. These applications run on servers that Express sets up to run in the Node.Js environment. 
      </p>
      <p> Express allows us to: 
        <ul>
          <li>Start up a server to listen for requests</li>
          <li>Parse incoming requests</li>
          <li>Craft our http response and associated content</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Express is a framework not a library. A framework is basically a set of bricks that we use to create our building whereas a library is like an extra ingredient in a cake that we can include when and where we want.
      </p>

    <div class="notes">
      <h2>Getting Started with Express</h2>
      <p>
        To begin setting up an Express server we are going to create a new directory. From within this new directory we will use <em>npm init</em> to create our package.json file.
      </p>
      <p>
        From that point we will install express through npm by entering <em>npm i express</em>.
        Once installed, create a javascript file and require the package by calling <em>const express = require("express");</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Next we will want to execute the Express function and have that returned object saved to a variable. <em>const app = express();</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to begin listening on a server we will utilize a method named .listen() which accepts two parameters. The first is the port which is to be listened to and a callback function with the actions to be performed when the listening begins.
      </p>
      <p>
        The server created by this method only runs locally on the machine and can't be called by outside networks. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The port entered to the .listen method can be used by browsers to access the server. Typing localhost:port# into the search bar will take you to the server page. 
      </p>
      <p>
        However, a 404 error will activate because there is no response or content being delivered by the server. It is only listening but does not have a response set up.
      </p>
      <p>
        To set up a response, at least when a request is received we us the <em>app.use()</em> method which accepts a callback function. The callback will run each and every time there is a request on the server.
      </p>
      <p>
        After including this method inside the code, whenever we even so much as visit the port (which of course is making a request the same way the visiting any site is makinga request), the actions defined in our app.use method will be executed in the console.
      </p>
      <p>
        Important note: if you have an express app running on port 3000 and want to run another express app simultaneously it MUST be ran on a different port such as 8080.
      </p>
      <h2>Diving deeper into the app.use() method</h2>
      <p>
        In order to begin issuing repsonses to requests made on the server we need to utilize the parameters that can be passed into the .use methods callback function.
      </p>
      <p>
        The .use callback accepts two parameters named req and res respectively. Req is for request and res is for response. These two parameters are objects created by Express and passed into the callback.
      </p>
      <p>
        The response object has methods that can be called. The most important of which is .send <br> The .send method is what returns the HTTP response to the user with the desired data. .send can deliver multiple data types such as strings, numbers or even JS objects. .send will also convert those objects to JSON for the user to parse. 
      </p>
      <h2>Express Routing: .GET</h2>
      <p>
        Routing is a universal, server-side computer science concept and refers to handling incoming requests. A "path" is requested by a user and we match that path to a perdetermined response.
        For example a path could be the <em>/dogs</em> or <em>/help</em> or <em>/reviews</em> at the end of a url. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to properly route requests we will first need to comment out any of our .use responses. This is because .use responds to any and every http request. Once an http response is sent that request is fulfilled and the server will await the next one. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So to route our requests and dispatch the proper response we will use what is called the .get method. This method works just like .use but instead of only taking a call back as a parameter it also accepts the requested path. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, if the user is requesting the path of <em>/cats</em>, inside of our .get method we will write: <em>app.get('/cats', (req, res) => {})</em>.
        Inside of the callback function we will define the response that we want to send for that particular request.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we wanted to provide a response for a request of an invalid path we would use <em>'*'</em> as the path parameter in our .get method. It is important to include this response handler <strong>LAST</strong> in the code as the * path means ALL requests. Paths are handled in order. It is easiest for me to remember this by comparing it the Cascading principle in CSS. Requests are handled in a cascading manner and if the universal path response is first, then we will always respond with that handler.
      </p>
      <h2>Diving Deeper into Paths: Parameters</h2>
        <p>
          When you think of a website like Reddit, we know that there are thousands of subreddits. Each subreddit is its own path and each response is also unique. Paths and responses do not have to be hardcoded into the servers logic. That is where <em>patterns</em> come in.
        </p>
        <p>
          To setup a pattern, inside of our .get request where we put the path we will include something like this: <em>'/r/:subreddit'</em>. This format tells the server that we are looking for a path that begins with /r/ and it will accept whatever comes after the colon as long as the /r/ pattern matches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the question becomes how can we tailor a specific response to a pattern that can be anything? Well the first step is to utilize the <strong>.params</strong> property on the req object. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When we include a path to be matched by setting a pattern in the path parameter of a request, the portion of the path that varies will be saved to a property called .params
        </p>
        <p>
          This property can be accessed and saved to a variable through deconstructing like so: <em>const {subreddit} = req.params;</em> ---- Now we have the portion of the pattern after the colon saved as a string variable (in this case the variable is named subreddit) that we can use for a response.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can chain patterns together to handle more complex and specific requests such as passing <em>app.get('/r/:subreddit/comments/:postID')</em> into the path paramter. This will allow us to extract two different values from the .params property and use them as we see fit. 
        </p>
        <h2>Query Strings</h2>
          <p>
            Query strings are tacked onto the end of a path and they narrow down the data that is being asked for from the server. For example, ino ur get method we could write <em>app.get('/search')</em> and then inside the callback we would write <em>const {q} = req.query;</em> 
          </p>
          <p>
            The query property is similar to the params property from earlier. We are able to pull the query by destructuring and save it to a variable. In this case we are calling the query q. So in order to hit this request in browser we need to type <em>localhost:3000/search?q=searchTerm</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to note that the ? signifies the beginning of a query string in the http address. Query strings can be comprised of multiple key value pairs and must be separated by an & symbol. 
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also important to note that we set what the key is. In our case we used q as the key. But if we change that q to something crazy like elephants, than the key would indeed be set to elephants.
